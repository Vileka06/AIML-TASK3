# AIML-TASK3
Goal: Predict house prices by applying a linear regression model on the Housing dataset.

Dataset:
Used the Housing.csv dataset 
housing-price-prediction

Process: [
Cleaned and prepared the data before training a linear regression model.

Model Training:
Fit a linear regression model and assessed its performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.

Visualization:
Compared the predicted prices against the actual values using a plot.

Technologies and Libraries:
Used Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment with Pandas and NumPy for data handling, Scikit-learn for building the regression model, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.
